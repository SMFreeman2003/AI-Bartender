basic sugar syrup

2 cups granulated sugar
1 cup (8 fl. oz.) cold water

Put granulated sugar in a heavy-based saucepan, add cold water, and let
stand for 5 minutes to give the sugar crystals time to absorb the water
and soften. Place over a low heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar
has completely dissolved and the liquid is clear. Bring to the boil, then
lower the heat again, and simmer for 1 minute. Remove the pan from
the stove, skim any scum from the surface of the syrup, and leave to
cool. Pour into jars, cover, and store.

equipment
Screw-top jars, ordinary kitchen spoons, wooden rolling pins, or pestles,
measuring spoons or cups, and a cooler packed with ice, can all double
as shakers, stirrers, muddlers, jiggers, and ice buckets, but if you plan to
become a serious cocktail maker, it’s worth investing in proper, good-
quality equipment.

jigger

A spirit measure, usually with a cup at each end. The smaller cup holds a
single shot of 
1 fl. oz. (equivalent to 2 tablespoons), the larger a double shot of 2 fl. oz.
(4 tablespoons). 
Get comfortable with using a jigger when making cocktails, even if
you’re measuring less than 1 fl. oz. Soon you’ll use it with as much ease
as a measuring spoon or cup.

bar spoon

A long-handled spoon, made of stainless steel, with a fairly flat bowl.
Used for stirring drinks and for pouring one spirit on top of another
when making layered cocktails.

muddler

A wooden, pestle-like tool used to mash or squash fresh fruit and herbs
together in the bottom of a glass or shaker to release their aroma and
flavor.

shaker

Two basic types of cocktail shaker are available. The standard model is
made of stainless steel and generally consists of three components: a
canister for holding ice, a tight-fitting lid with a built-in strainer, and a
twist-off cap. The Boston shaker usually comes in two pieces: a mixing
glass as the base and a stainless steep top. A strainer — such as the
popular hawthorn strainer — is needed to filter the cocktail from this
type of shaker into a glass. A shaker may be glamorous, but a jam jar
with a tight-fitting screw-top lid will work equally well.

electric blender

A real timesaver for making crushed ice. A heavy-duty blender or food
processor with robust blades and a powerful motor is needed to crush ice
cubes, otherwise break them up first by placing them in a strong plastic
bag and bashing with a hammer or rolling pin. To extend the life of the
blades, process the fruit or other ingredients before adding the ice.

measuring cup

A large measuring cup is useful for mixing large quantities of cocktails.
Make up batches and keep in sealed jars or bottles in the fridge. Shake
well before serving.

ice cube bags

These take up less room in the freezer than ice cube trays. You can pull
out just the number of cubes you need rather than having to empty the
whole tray.

ice bucket

Essential for storing ice cubes. Use tongs or a small scoop to dispense the
ice — never your hands. Not only is it unhealthy — frozen fingers are
agony!

kitchen basics

A small serrated knife, vegetable peeler (for shaving off strips of zest),
chopping board, citrus press or basic lemon squeezer, cloth to wipe up
spills, serving tray, and coasters are all useful to have at hand when
preparing and serving cocktails.

the right glass
Each type of cocktail has its own special shape of glass, but as long as
you follow a few basic rules, it’s not necessary to invest in all the
different styles.


Shot glasses are small, straight-sided, and used for single measures of
spirit, that are drunk neat. Short drinks served “on the rocks” need plain,
squat tumblers known as shorts, sours, or old-fashioned glasses. Those
with solid glass studs covering the base are designed for slammers and
therefore tougher than standard tumblers, as they must survive being
banged sharply on the table top before the drink inside is tossed down.


Tall, straight highball glasses and the slightly deeper collins glasses are
for long, mixed drinks, while the iconic Martini glass is stemmed with a
wide, triangular bowl. When simply a cocktail glass is specified in a
recipe, any small, stemmed glass that is wide at the top can be used,
including a Martini glass.


Saucer-shaped champagne glasses might look spectacular stacked high
for a sparkling wine pyramid fountain, but their lack of depth means the
bubbles in the wine disappear almost as soon as it is poured. For
champagne cocktails or any others made with sparkling wine, tall-
stemmed flutes are best because they trap the bubbles in the glass for
longer. Any cocktail served without ice should be poured into a stemmed
glass so the drinker’s hand doesn’t warm the cool mix inside.


Creamy piña coladas and other blended drinks — particularly those from
the Caribbean islands — are often served in stemmed goblets or tulip-
shaped glasses, while large-bowled brandy balloons allow plenty of
leeway for swirling and inhaling the spirit’s aroma. When choosing
glasses, one with a fine rim is generally more pleasant to drink from
than a 
thick-edged, heavy glass, and a long, slender stem sits more comfortably
in the hand.




preparing glasses

Always chill glasses in the freezer for half an hour (no longer or they
might crack) or in the refrigerator for an hour. To frost a glass, bury it in
crushed ice or leave it in the fridge until very cold. When serving long,
  mixed drinks, fill highball glasses half to three-quarters full with ice
  cubes before pouring in the drink. Never reuse ice; it must be fresh every
  time.




  salting or sugaring the rim

  Rub the rim of the glass with a wedge of lemon or lime, and dip the rim
  in fine salt or superfine sugar, depending on the cocktail you are
  making.
